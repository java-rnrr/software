# How to find the location of your Android sdk platform tools: bring up 
# Android Studio: Tools->SDK Manager (then look at Android SDK Location). 
# Note that adb is found in this directory, also.  In the path below, 
# replace the path with the one that corresponds to your installation. 
# Yours should not include coda since that is my installation and is 
# different from yours.  Remove the comment '#' from the beginning of
# the export line below and change the path to the Android SDK to your
# path using the instruction above.  Also change the path to the tkdiff
# tool to the location to which you installed it on your machine.

#export PATH=$PATH:/Users/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_USER_NAME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:/Users/REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_USER_NAME/Downloads/tkdiff-4-3-5
